My name is Jan Smitmans and I am a freelance Software Engineer in Test / Test Architect located in Germany. 

I worked in various software development teams in different areas of business and learned quite a few things about test automation and DevOps along the way. :relieved:

Here I will be present some of the best practices, techniques, frameworks and mindsets that I have explored in years of working as a test automation engineer.

No-frills, no bullshit, just practical advice and code examples.
